Those who do not show promise or become damaged during their growth are forced into the lower caste of tool workers, servants, and farmers. The schools of the sky-claves are known for their prestige and those born to a higher status are given every opportunity that their parentage can garner for them. Those of the lower caste must prove themselves quickly and avoid the tampering of the highborn in order to ascend among their people. The civilization can be brutal with highborn parents disowning or “un-naming” a fledgling entirely treating them as though they were from a different family.",

Many humans prefer to deal with these creatures as they often offer both unique goods and interesting insights into the world at large. They are slower to act and are often laid back in their attitudes. The society is more forgiving, as almost a way to cope with how many were treat poorly in their time with the Sky-claves. However, they have learned to let go of their grudges so long as the others let go of their prejudices and are a very understanding people. They are quick to forgive, but make no mistake; they never forget.",

                        "Eleven society is centered around their conclaves and live in tight nit communities knotted throughout their forests, which have a tendency to have “cruelty” towards outsiders. This reputation stems from 'fact' that elves invite intruders to partake in ancient ritual during which they partake in the tribes most sacred of meals… the unsuspecting traveler himself. The reality is that in most (not all) situations the intruder was a woodsman or hunter that was given warnings to stop their forays into their groves. To cease their deforestation or hunting of their beast brothers. But elves will never let the death of a creature be it human, beast, or even a demon go to waste. They view it as a last will of the creature to share its knowledge, emotion, or even vision as the last rite after the creature's death.",
						"As a result of this shared knowledge and their natural instincts garnered from their unusual birth, elven people are often seen as wise and long lived. They have the same lifespan as a regular human but each meal grants them more and more lived experience and differing outlooks. This makes most of them very esoteric. They have no aversion to eating others of their tribe after their death or that of a loved one wishing to be granted the last consolation of their memories. They know enough about other creatures and cultures to not do so openly or without asking in a respectable manner.",
                        "Once other races get past the stereotype placed upon the elves, they discover that eleven culture regards all life as sacred and to be protected and cherished. That most of them form strong friendships and bonds. They can be extremely affected if one of their loved ones die and they are not given the consolation of their people's burial rituals.",

				"You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.",
				"Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is {@condition restrained} by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a {@condition restrained} target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
				"The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already {@condition restrained} by the sphere falls out of it and lands {@condition prone} in a space within 5 feet of it.",
				"As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature {@condition restrained} by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.",
				"When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature {@condition restrained} by the sphere is knocked {@condition prone} in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes."
